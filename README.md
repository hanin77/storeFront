# MyStore Project Overview

MyStore is Angular application that allows users to view a list of available products to purchase, add them to a shopping cart, and ultimately complete the checkout process.

#### Project features

- **Product list** page, which displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their cart (in various quantities)
- **Product details** page, which displays more information about any particular product
- **Shopping cart**, which includes the products that the user has added to their cart
- **Checkout form**, which collects information about the user (e.g., name, address, payment details, etc.)
- **Order confirmation page**, which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process (i.e., submits the checkout form)

## Getting Started

1. `npm install` to install all dependencies
2. `npm run start` to start the server and get access using the url: http://localhost:4200
